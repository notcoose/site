## About Me

Hello, my name is Markus and it is nice to meet you!

I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Statistics at the University of Illinois Chicago, graduating in May 2026, and will be conducting LLM research with Professor Sourav Medya starting this spring.

I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Causal Inference and am working on learning more and getting myself involved in the exciting world of research on these topics. I hope to make the most of my time by consistently learning and doing cool things.

Some of the notable things I did the past are conducting Functional Data Analysis research under Professor Kyunghee Han, assisting teaching for Discrete Math and Python courses, and working on an unlaunched start-up. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy going to concerts,  exploring Chicago, playing Fortnite with friends, and spending time in the woods.
## What I'm Currently doing
#### December 2024

-  Working on creating a personal website (this one!) with the goal of hosting my bio, CV, project pages, and notes on various topics
-  Trying to learn more, I'm admittedly a "beginner" in the Machine Learning World and there's so much I don't even know that I don't know! Specifically, I'm utilizing Ilya's [30u30](https://github.com/jayxin/Ilya-30u30) and Goodfellow et al.'s [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
-  Attempting to find and get into an optimal routine. I have an ambitious plate of research, classes, and club leadership next semester so I must "lock in"
